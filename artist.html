        <p>ClamsCasino, real name Michael Volpe, is an American Hip Hop musician, record producer, and songwriter.
            Based in Nutley, New Jersey, he has produced tracks for artists such as A$Ap Rocky, Lil B, Vince Staples,
            and Mac Miller. He also has remixed works by Big K.R.I.T., Washed Out, and Lana Del Rey. Clams Casino's debut EP
            Rainforest was released in 2011. His Instrumentals mixtape was also released in March of the same year. Followed by the release of
            Instrumentals 2 in 2012 and Instrumentals 3 in 2013. The mixtapes were distrubuted for free through his <a href="http://clammyclams.com/">website</a>.

          On 32 Levels, Clams approaches the question from two different angles. On the A side, we hear him staying in his lane and refining his craft,
          cutting back on samples in favor of instrumental recordings, denser arrangements and tighter compositions. On the B side, Clams looks beyond his
          comfort zone, pushing toward mainstream pop with mixed results. Versatility, it turns out, may not be Clams’ strong suit, though that’s hardly a problem;
          as the first half of 32 Levels demonstrates, there’s still plenty of room left for Clams Casino to grow into his own sound. The biggest question that he now
          faces is what distinguishes him as an artist—not just from the "cloud rap” beatmakers who followed in his footsteps, but from big-name producers like Noah “40”
          Shebib and Metro Boomin who mine similar terrain.
